# Web Crawler

A small project to familiarise myself again with Ruby. I have in the past written a web crawler before, so I thought it to be a good exercise to try and do this again.

In the past I have written this in Go, a language that lends itself well for crawling thanks to its multi-threading. An interesting challenge will be to see how I design a crawler in Ruby.

## Set up
To initialise the project, ensure [bundler](https://bundler.io/) is installed and run:
```
bundle install
```

## Testing
To run all tests, run:
```
rspec
```
